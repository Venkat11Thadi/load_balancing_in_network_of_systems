# load_balancing_in_network_of_systems

- computer systems are considered as nodes of a graph
- interconnections are treated as edges of the graph
- we traverse the acquired graph inorder to get optimal path within the graph
- whenever job enters network, it flows through graph inorder to find best system to get processed

input:
- enter number of nodes and edges
- then enter processing power and number of available slots of each system
- enter the edges 
- enter number of systems connected to main server
- enter connected systems
- at last, enter number of jobs to be processed

output:
- we print the jobs allocated to each system
- and the path we followed to allocate job
